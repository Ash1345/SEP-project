          <div><span> 1. WHAT IS LGBTQ?</span>
          <div><span>LGBTQ is an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning. These terms are used to describe a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.</span></div>
        </div>
          <div id="def"><span>LESBIAN</span>
          <div id="info"><span>A woman whose enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction is to other women. Some lesbians may prefer to identify as gay or as gay women.</span></div>
        </div>
          <div id="def"><span>GAY</span>
          <div id="info"><span>The adjective used to describe people whose enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attractions are to people of the same sex. Sometimes lesbian is the preferred term for women.</span></div>
        </div>
          <div id="def"><span>BISEXUAL</span>
          <div id="info"><span>A person who has the capacity to form enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attractions to those of the same gender or to those of another gender. People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their lifetime. Bisexual people need not have had specific sexual experiences to be bisexual; in fact, they need not have had any sexual experience at all to identify as bisexual.</span></div>
        </div>  
          <div id="def"><span>TRANSGENDER</span>
            <div id="info"><span>An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. People under the transgender umbrella may describe themselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms— including transgender. Many transgender people are prescribed hormones by their doctors to bring their bodies into alignment with their gender identity. Some undergo surgery as well. But not all transgender people can or will take those steps, and a transgender identity is not dependent upon physical appearance or medical procedures.</span></div>
          </div>
            <div id="def"><span>QUEER</span>
            <div id="info"><span>An adjective used by some people, particularly younger people, whose sexual orientation is not exclusively heterosexual. Typically, for those who identify as queer, the terms lesbian, gay, and bisexual are perceived to be too limiting and/or fraught with cultural connotations they feel don’t apply to them. Some people may use queer, or more commonly genderqueer, to describe their gender identity and/or gender expression. Once considered a pejorative term, queer has been reclaimed by some LGBT people to describe themselves; however, it is not a universally accepted term even within the LGBT community.</span></div>          
          </div>
            <div id="def"><span>QUESTIONING</span>
              <div id="info"><span>Sometimes, when the Q is seen at the end of LGBT, it can also mean questioning. This term describes someone who is questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity.</span></div>
            </div>
            <div id="def"><span>2. ABSTRACT</span>
            <div id="info"><span>Factors associated with the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth were qualitatively examined to better understand how these factors are experienced from the youths’ perspectives. Largely recruited from LGBTQ youth groups, 68 youth participated in focus groups (n = 63) or individual interviews (n = 5). The sample included 50% male, 47% female, and 3% transgender participants. Researchers used a consensual methods approach to identify negative and positive factors across 8 domains. Negative factors were associated with families, schools, religious institutions, and community or neighborhood; positive factors were associated with the youth's own identity development, peer networks, and involvement in the LGBTQ community. These findings suggest a pervasiveness of negative experiences in multiple contexts, and the importance of fostering a positive LGBTQ identity and supportive peer/community networks. Efforts should work towards reducing and eliminating the prejudicial sentiments often present in the institutions and situations that LGBTQ youth encounter.</span></div>

          <div id="def"><span> 3. How do we solve LGBTQ+ discrimination? One word: visibility ?</span>
            <div id="info"><span>As many workplaces, and even entire industries, continue to work on building inclusive and diverse environments, I am reminded of Harvey Milk, one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. With the 40th anniversary of his assassination recently behind us, there still is much we can learn from him.

            Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, following a tenure as a political spokesperson for the city’s LGBTQ+ (then known as LGB) community and founder of a business association of predominantly LGBTQ+ merchants.
            
            Once in office, Milk supported LGBTQ+ rights, notably sponsoring an anti-discrimination bill and opposing a ballot initiative that would have mandated the firing of gay teachers in California public schools. He championed inclusive policies for other marginalized groups as well, including women (particularly working mothers) and minorities.</span></div>

        <div id="def"><span>4. LGBT rights in India</span>
          <div id="info"><span>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in India have evolved in recent years. However, Indian LGBT citizens face certain social and legal difficulties not experienced by non-LGBT persons. Same-sex sexual activity was decriminalized in 2018. The country has repealed its colonial-era laws that directly discriminated against homosexual and transgender identities and also explicitly interpreted Article 15 of the Constitution to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. But many legal protections have not been provided for, including same-sex marriage.</span></div>
          <div id="info"><span>Transgender people in India are allowed to change their legal gender post-sex reassignment surgery under legislation passed in 2019, and have a constitutional right to register themselves under a third gender. Additionally, some states protect hijras, a traditional third gender population in South Asia through housing programmes, and offer welfare benefits, pension schemes, free operations in government hospitals as well as other programmes designed to assist them. There are approximately 480,000 transgender people in India.</span>
