        <p>The basic eligibility requirement for admission to ME/MTech programme is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Candidates who have completed their BE/BTech degree with a valid score in GATE are eligible for ME/MTech
                degree course.</li>
            <li>Candidates who have completed a 5-year program in Science or Applied Sciences resulting in the award of
                a Master of Science degree are also eligible for Master of Engineering course.</li>
            <li>Admission is based on rank obtained in the entrance test conducted for ME./MTech.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that the ME/MTech eligibility criteria would vary from institute to institute.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE): Entrance Exam for MTech</h2>
        <p>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering or popularly known as GATE is a national-level engineering exam
            conducted every year for admission to postgraduate and doctorate level courses at IITs, NITs and IIITs. The
            exam is jointly conducted by seven IITs (Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Guwahati, Kharagpur, Madras and Roorkee) and
            the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.
        </p>

        <p> Various government and private institutions across the country accept the GATE score for admission to their
            MTech programmes. Moreover, Public Sector Units (PSUs) also recruit engineers through GATE.
        </p>

        <p> In 2020, GATE will be organised by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in online mode on February
            1, 2, 8 and 9. GATE 2020 will be conducted in 25 papers including the newly added subject, Biomedical
            Engineering. Application forms for GATE 2020 will be available from September 3, 2019, and the last date to
            apply for the same is September 24. GATE scores will be valid for a period of three years from the date of
            the release of the GATE 2020 result i.e. March 16.
