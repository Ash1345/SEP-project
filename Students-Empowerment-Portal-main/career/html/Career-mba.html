        <h1>What is <span> Masters of Business Administration?</span></h1>
        <p>
            We hear the term “MBA” all the time. But what does an MBA really signify, and what can it do for your career? Discover all you need to know about how an MBA can propel you forward professionally.
        </p>
        <p>What is an MBA? A Master of Business Administration, or MBA, is a general graduate business degree that teaches students technical, managerial, and leadership skills. Earning an MBA gives you valuable business acumen, expands your professional network, and creates new opportunities. It’s an ideal option to consider whether you want to accelerate your career trajectory, transition to a new industry, or become an entrepreneur.
        </p>
        
        <h1>What can you expect from an MBA degree?</h1>
        <p>What you can expect from an MBA ultimately depends on the curriculum you choose. MBA programs come in many different shapes and sizes, from full-time one- and two-year programs to part-time, flexible, online, and executive MBAs (EMBA). Some programs offer courses in-person, while others are online or a hybrid of both. Weigh factors such as your level of experience, the program’s location, and your employment status as you evaluate which MBA program is right for you.</p>
         <p>
            An MBA is a generalist degree that covers a variety of business principles, such as accounting, economics, finance, and marketing. Throughout your program, you’ll apply ideas from the classroom during real-world consulting projects and gain exposure to an array of business functions. You’ll also learn from your classmates’ and others’ practical experience via group work and case studies. The end result is a comprehensive set of business and management skills you can apply to a wide range of industries and career tracks.
          </p>
        <h1>How to know if an MBA is right for you</h1>
        <p>If you’re looking for more flexibility after graduation and hoping to gain skills that all employers value, then pursuing an MBA degree is right for you. This flexible degree provides the in-demand capabilities you need to take on a managerial role, break into a new industry, or simply earn more money.</p>  
        <p>MBA programs attract applicants with work experience from all industries. While there’s no perfect time to pursue an MBA, most programs prefer or require prior experience—some more than others. For example, most applicants to full-time MBA programs have between three and six years’ experience, whereas most Executive MBA applicants have 10 or more years’ experience, according to the Application Trends Survey from the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC).</p>
        <p>However, there are programs designed for recent bachelor’s graduates, as well as programs for recent graduates who did not study business as undergraduates. When it comes to MBA candidates’ undergraduate studies, more than half hold nonbusiness-related degrees (54 percent), while 46 percent have previously studied business.</p>
        <h1>
            How long does it take to get your MBA?
        </h1>
        <p>The duration of your MBA depends on which program format you choose. On average, full-time MBAs take 18 months to complete, followed by EMBAs (20 months), and professional MBAs (26 months part time, flexible, and online). Most prospective MBA students prefer full-time enrollment with in-person coursework; however, different programs are appropriate for different students. Read more about full-time two-year MBA, full-time one-year MBA, and part-time MBA programs to help you decide which best meets your needs.</p>
        <p>Another graduate business degree option is a Masters in Management (MiM), which also takes an average of 18 months to complete. This option is perfect for recent bachelor’s graduates with little or no work experience.</p>
        
        <p> Broadly speaking, there are 9 popular National Level MBA entrance exams in India for MBA admission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CAT</li>
            <li>GMAT</li>
            <li>MAT</li>
            <li>XAT</li>
            <li>NMAT</li>
            <li>SNAP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of the State level exams like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MAH CET</li>
            <li>TANCET</li>
            <li>PGCET</li>
            <li>KMAT</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore, deciding between taking the GMAT and CAT is a dilemma faced by a countless number of Indian MBA aspirants as both serve as a stepping stone to gaining admission into an MBA program.</p> 
        <h2>GMAT vs CAT</h2> 
        <p>CAT an GMAT are some exams which are always confused upon.</p>
        <p>Both the GMAT and the CAT serve as a standardised test for admission to MBA programs. However, both differ in scope of their acceptability. GMAT is a global exam accepted by more than 7000 MBA programs worldwide whereas CAT is accepted only by Indian business schools.</p>    
        <p>They are both designed to provide a measure of skills such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Quantitative ability  
            </li>
            <li>
                Reasoning skills</li>
            <li>
                Data Interpretation  
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="table-one">

        <h2>Important FAQs Regarding MBA</h2>
        <h4>Q. Who should provide my recommendation letters?</h4>
        <p> <strong>A.</strong> Current employers or business peers, members of academia who assisted you during previous studies or business projects can always support your applications by submitting recommendation letters.</p>
<p>The submission procedure varies from an institution to another, but most of the business schools warn their applicants whenever recommendation letters need to be accompanied by standardized evaluation forms or be sent separately. Typically, your reference persons submit their letters directly to the office of admission.

</p>
        <h4>Q. What are my chances to get acceted into an MBA program?</h4>
        <p> <strong>A.</strong> Depending on where business schools set the bar, the selection process can value different aspects of their applicants' experience. Universities value the international profile of the applicants, their cross-border visionary ideas for business and the impression made during the interview</p>
        <p>However, many business schools set the maximum number of intakes per year to a very low. Top programs receive very few candidates per year - being interested in a close teacher - student interaction - , which makes the admission more competitive. Online MBA programs or part-time study options are more flexible with these digits and concentrate on diversity and interaction in their (virtual) classrooms, while maintaining an optimal teacher to student number ratio.</p>
        
        <h4>Q. Which is the average cost of an MBA?</h4>
        <p> <strong>A.</strong> The tuition fee varies with institution, accreditation and location, pace of learning, international exchange opportunities and the specialization of MBA programs.  The costs of the top MBA programs usually exceeds 100, 000 USD dollars.</p>
        <p>Living expenses are usually covered by applicants themselves or in separate agreements with the university housing, when lectures are held on campus at an intensive learning pace</p>
        
        <h4>Q.What MBA funding options are available?</h4>
        <p> <strong>A.</strong> Corporate sponsorship is the most common option of funding and also the most recommended one by the business schools and MBA graduates. Alternatively, other private organizations interested in your academic profile which are willing to recruit you in a business management position upon graduation can provide you with partial or full sponsorship.</p>
        <p>Note that this option involves an individual agreement between the applicant and the funding company and it does not involve any official agreement with the business school.</p>
        <p>Merit-based scholarships: Based on the funding available, business schools offer merit- based scholarships to a limited number of applicants, which typically cover a part of the tuition fee. The application process is outlined separately from the admission application.</p>
        
        <h4>Q. What study exchange options are included in business administration programs?</h4>
        <p> <strong>A.</strong> The ‘next big thing’ of MBA education is the study on more than one continent in international groups of students. The varied options of study abroad allow an intensive exchange of practical experience and actual implementation strategies pertaining to country-specific business climates.</p>
        <p>Candidates can choose dual / joint degrees provided by two or more institutions, typically in different countries or continents. Additionally, applicants have the liberty to choose where to spend a semester abroad or make internship abroad.</p>
        <h4>Q. What is an alumni network?</h4>
        <p> <strong>A.</strong> Upon completion of their MBA or EMBA studies, business school graduates are registered in the alumni network of the respective university. Members of the alumni netwok keep in touch even decades after their graduation. Sharing impressions, career updates and job recommendations are excellent ways to build upon your class experience and keep a high profile in your class of graduates.

        </p>
        <p>Alumni networks bring together different generations of MBA graduates that continued their successful career in business administration and are willing to share insight with their former colleagues.</p>
        
        
        <h4>Q. How does an MBA degree improve your career prospects?</h4>
        <p> <strong>A.</strong>The main reward of graduating with an MBA degree is the practical business knowledge acquired, rewarded with a significant increase in salary. Graduates of our recommended MBA programs and executive masters report an salary increase of over 150%.</p>
